		<p>Hello, I’m Rae, <br>
		Here’s what I know is important about content:</p>
		<p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>emotional intelligence:</b> first, understand user intent and mindset, then write to that. Start with three key messages for the piece and go from there.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 18px;"> <b>write to trigger engagement:</b> the average attention span is around 5 seconds nowadays, so write to engage the time-pressed online scan reader. There are a few writing techniques that will get you there. </p>

		<p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>content creation is the calm in the dev ops storm</b> -  I find it takes: </p>
		<p style="font-size: 18px;"><b>a battle hardened methodology:</b> like most I always start with a roadmap, one that is content based in form and designed to map the content work out into a set of tasks and integrated outcomes dependencies against deadlines. Typically in a simple Excel format, my approach has a unique content focus that keeps the edit cycle on track. I can show you what that looks like, it’s oddly comforting to see the clear map.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 18px;"> <b>a good toolset: </b> yes, content toolsets are a real thing (described below). We needed to keep our edit work going strong and at pace so we created a set of assets to do just that. My goal is to get it right the first time so 0% rewrite requests and happy content owners making for return business.</p>
